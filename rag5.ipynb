    "# RAG with Weaviate and local embedding model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this chapter we will:\n",
    "1. Replace OpenAI's embedding model with a local one called ```nomic-embed-text```.\n",
    "2. Load the embedding into a new vector database (With the same structure).\n",
    "3. Query the database.\n",
    "4. Pass the result along with the query to the LLM\n",
    "We can then compare whether the results were any worse than those of the OpenAI embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A local embedding model\n",
    "As we saw in the previous chapter, OpenAI throttles our embedding and slows the process down. The rate appeared to be 5 embeddings per second. Not quick. In addition, OpenAI is also charging us for the pleasure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting going\n",
    "[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) allows you to run LLMs locally. While I run on a 6 year-old Linux machine with an ancient AMD GPU, I am going to see if that's enough to host a small embedding model like Nomic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run, download Ollama and [follow the instructions here](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) on how to pull Nomic using Ollama's command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new database\n",
    "We will start by creating a new collection/database in Weaviate. The database will have the same structure as we will still use Langchain's tools to read and split the PDFs."

    "We can compare this answer to running it with ChatGPT4o, which answered:\n",
    "> To answer the question **\"What is the most efficient method to manage memory and ensure optimal performance when using the ADSP-BF539’s Direct Memory Access (DMA) for continuous data transfers, and how can you avoid DMA aborts during high-priority tasks?\"**, we can break it down based on key elements from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 1. **Optimizing Memory Management for DMA Transfers:**\n",
    ">   - **Proper Allocation of Data Buffers:** A key technique is to **avoid memory conflicts** by carefully allocating data buffers within banks and pages of memory. The use of **autobuffering** or **descriptors** can reduce the need for unnecessary MMR (memory-mapped register) accesses, which can stall the DMA【156:0†source】.\n",
    ">   - **Minimize Direction Changes (Thrashing):** The processor's **traffic control features** help reduce efficiency losses caused by direction changes (i.e., switching from read to write or vice versa). Traffic control mechanisms, such as **DMACx_TC_PER** and **DMACx_TC_CNT** registers, can automatically optimize transfer direction and limit real-time processor intervention【156:0†source】【156:17†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 2. **Ensuring Optimal Performance:**\n",
    ">   - **Channel Prioritization:** The ADSP-BF539 DMA channels are serviced based on priority, where lower-numbered channels get higher priority. Thus, peripherals requiring low-latency or high-throughput should be assigned to **lower-numbered DMA channels** via **DMAx_PERIPHERAL_MAP** registers【156:0†source】. This allows these peripherals to avoid being starved of DMA access by less important tasks.\n",
    ">   - **Round Robin Scheduling for MDMA:** When multiple memory DMA (MDMA) streams are enabled, the **MDMA_ROUND_ROBIN_PERIOD** can be configured to ensure that all streams share bandwidth fairly. This helps prevent starvation of lower-priority streams while maintaining high throughput【156:0†source】【156:4†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### 3. **Avoiding DMA Aborts:**\n",
    ">  - **Error Handling:** The **DMA_ERROR interrupt** is triggered when certain conditions are detected, such as disallowed register writes, address alignment errors, or access to unpopulated memory spaces【156:2†source】【156:4†source】. To prevent these issues, ensure the **DMA_CONFIG register** is properly set and that memory addresses are aligned according to the specified word size. Additionally, **descriptors** should be configured correctly, especially when crossing memory boundaries【156:6†source】.\n",
    ">   - **MDMA Stream Configuration:** Ensure that **source and destination streams** are properly synchronized. Errors can occur if the configuration of word sizes or memory spaces between source and destination is incorrect【156:18†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    ">### 4. **Handling High-Priority Tasks:**\n",
    ">   - **Interrupt-based Synchronization:** It’s crucial to synchronize the completion of DMA tasks with software using interrupts rather than polling, which can lead to delays. Polling is not recommended due to pipeline and FIFO delays, which can result in synchronization issues between core and DMA operations【156:13†source】.\n",
    ">   - **Handling DMA Latency:** To avoid high-latency issues, careful arbitration must be managed between the **DMA controllers** and core processor when accessing internal memory. Ensure that **peripheral DMA** does not interfere with memory DMA, which can lead to **underflow** or **overflow** conditions【156:5†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Conclusion:\n",
    ">Efficiently managing memory during DMA operations in the ADSP-BF539 requires careful **buffer allocation**, **traffic control**, and **prioritization** of high-priority channels. Additionally, preventing DMA aborts can be achieved through correct **configuration** of descriptors and **synchronization** using interrupts rather than polling.\n",
    "\n",
    ">By leveraging **round-robin scheduling**, **traffic control mechanisms**, and **interrupt-based synchronization**, you can maximize DMA performance while minimizing the risk of errors and aborts during high-priority tasks."

      "4. **Descriptor Management:** In auto buffer mode, terminate DMA transfers gracefully by writing to the DMAx_CONFIG register with the DMA_EN bit set to 0. Ensure that any ongoing slow memory read operations are completed before re-enabling the DMA channel to avoid conflicts.\n",

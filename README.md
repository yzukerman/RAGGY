# RAG Example
## Overview
We will create a RAG application that searches a set of PDF documents from the Analog Devices websites and produces human-readable answers.
To accomplish that, we will use the [Weaviate](https://weaviate.com) database and the OpenAI API. 
You will need to have Docker installed as we will use a containerized version of Weaviate.
